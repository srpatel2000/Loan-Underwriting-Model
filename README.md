## Feature Engineering and Preprocessing

To preprocess the data, we began filtering the dataset to the following relevent columns.
* Credit Score
* Metropolitan Statistical Area
* Number of Units
* Occupancy Status
* Original Combined Loan-To-Value 
* Original Debt-To-Income (DTI) Ratio
* Original Loan-To-Value (LTV) 
* Original Interest Rate
* Prepayment Penalty Mortgage (PPM) Flag
* Property Type 
* Loan Sequence Number (needed for merging with monthly performance dataset)
* Super Conforming Flag
* Harp Indicator

We choose the above relevent column based on ["7 Factors That Affect a Loan Application"]](https://loans.usnews.com/articles/beyond-credit-scores-factors-that-affect-a-loan-application)
